## Primary Dashboard

- **Title:** Online Retail II — Revenue, Segments & Retention
- **Public URL:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harshit.agrawal3738/viz/capstone_dva2final/Dashboard1?publish=yes
- **Published by:** Harshit Aggarwal
- **Last updated:** 2026-04-29

## Structure

The dashboard has four connected views:

1. **Revenue Overview** — Net revenue by month, country, top-20% concentration
2. **Customer Segments** — RFM segments, segment-level revenue + AOV
3. **Product Performance** — Top/bottom SKUs, return-rate by category hint
4. **Retention Health** — Repeat-purchase rate, cohort retention heatmap

## Filters (interactive — required by rubric)

- Country (multi-select)
- Date range (InvoiceDate)
- RFM segment (single-select)
- Registered vs Guest checkout

## Data Source

Source CSV: `data/processed/tableau_final_load.csv` (produced by `notebooks/05_final_load_prep.ipynb`).
Never hard-code numbers in the workbook — all values must come from the connected data source.

## Screenshots

See `tableau/screenshots/` for PNG exports of each view. Naming convention: `01_overview.png`, `02_segments.png`, `03_products.png`, `04_retention.png`.
