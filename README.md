# SectionX_TeamY_OnlineRetailInsights

> **TODO — rename this folder, the repo, and this heading.** Use the convention `SectionName_TeamID_ProjectName`. Example: `B_Team04_RetailPulse`. You also need to pick a real `ProjectName` your team agrees on — "OnlineRetailInsights" is a placeholder.

Capstone 2 analytics project for the Data Visualization & Analytics course at ADYPU. We analyze a UK online retailer's transactional data (Dec 2009 – Dec 2011) to identify revenue-driving customer segments, at-risk repeat buyers, and product-level profitability — ultimately recommending where the retailer should reallocate retention and promotional spend.

## Problem Statement

For a mid-market UK e-commerce retailer operating across ~40 countries, identify **(a)** the customer segments and product categories that drive the top 20% of revenue, **(b)** the magnitude and drivers of churn in the repeat-purchase base, and **(c)** a prioritized reallocation of retention and promotional budget that protects the revenue-concentration base while recovering at-risk customers.

Full problem framing, business context, and sub-questions: see [`docs/gate1_proposal.md`](docs/gate1_proposal.md).

## Sector

Retail / E-commerce.

## Dashboard

Live Tableau Public link: see [`tableau/dashboard_links.md`](tableau/dashboard_links.md).

## Team & Roles

See [`docs/roles.md`](docs/roles.md) for the 5-member role split and ownership map.

## Contribution Matrix

See [`docs/contribution_matrix.md`](docs/contribution_matrix.md). This must match GitHub Insights at submission time — faculty audits commit + PR history per member.

## Git Workflow (mandatory)

1. `main` is protected — no direct pushes
2. Every change goes through a **feature branch** and a **pull request**
3. Branch naming: `feat/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, `docs/<short-desc>`
4. At least one teammate reviews each PR before merge
5. Commit messages use conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`

This ensures every member has visible PR activity — the audit rule the faculty explicitly warns about.
